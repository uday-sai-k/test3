        <hr />
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Kammula's films often focuses on the relationship between men and
          women in their routine life circumstances filled with both happiness
          and hardships. Sankeertana Varma of Film Companion calls film
          portrayal of his female characters as somewhat "special." She writes
          that they aren't particular "strong women" but they are real. Varma
          adds that though his female characters display their egos and throw
          tantrums, they are unbreakable and refuse to fit in the typical
          societal norms expected from a normal woman.[16] Kammula has also
          appreciated the work of other directors including the recent Telugu
          hit Vaarasudu.[17]
